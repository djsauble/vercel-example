              ‰Ω†Â•Ω Hello! Thank you for reading this and spending time to know
              me. Welcome to my user guide. The faster we get to know each other
              and how we work, the stronger our relationship will be, and the
              more we'll accomplish together. I keep learning from others and
              growing my personal and professional skills, so I will keep
              updating this user guide to reflect the newest "me".
            </p>
            <h3>ü§î Who am I?</h3>
            <p>
              I am from China üá®üá≥ Do you know why I put a "fish" icon in the
              title? Because the last word of my Chinese name is 'Yu", the
              pronunciation is exactly the same as "fish" in Chinese. Some of my
              Chinese friends call me Â∞èÈ±ºÔºå"little Fish üêü".
            </p>
            <p>
              I am a Product Designer at DataStax, working on the Product Led
              Growth team. Before joining Datastax, I have experience working at
              big companies making consumer-faced products. It is my first time
              working on an enterprise product at a startup, it is a very
              challenging but enjoyable experiment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most of the time, I am extroverted and talkative, but sometimes, I
              am in a low battery mode so I am quiet.
            </p>
            <p>
              I never had good luck, which makes me believe I should work hard
              if I want to obtain any achievements.
            </p>
            Outside of work,
            <br />
            <br />
            - When I am hungry, I become anxious.
            <br />
            - I enjoy sharing my stories, thoughts, and life journey with other
            people, my 50k followers on social media can prove it.
            <br />
            - I have a collection of beautiful wooden music boxes.
            <br />

            <h3>üñãÔ∏è Me At Work</h3>
            <br />I am not a morning person, my brain doesn't work fully
            functional if I get up very early. I prefer to start my workday late
            and end late.
            <br />
            <br />I don't have a mature work habit, I keep changing and
            improving my current work habit by observing how other people work
            more efficiently.
            <br />
            <br />
            Writing is my weakness. I tried to avoid writing in the past, but
            now I have to accept the truth that writing is an integral part of
            our work. I have been aware of this weakness and improving it, but
            it takes some time. Please be patient with me.
            <br />
            <br />
            When I am very into an idea, I move too fast and forget to ask
            "why". I am improving it now.
            <br />
            <br />I like making friends with my colleagues, although I was told
            we should never make friends with coworkers. If I need to spend
            nearly 1/3 of my life with some people, I hope to spend the time
            with my friends.
            <h3>üëÇüèªCommunication</h3>
            <p>
              <br />- Slack is the best way to get in touch with me from 9 am -
              6 pm PST. I don't immediately open my emails, so please send me a
              message on Slack if you share anything with me in email and need
              my quick responses.
              <br />- If we have to send many messages back and forth on Slack,
              I feel like a quick meeting is more productive. Recently I have
              been struggling with having too many meetings, so I will be
              thinking more before sending out a meeting invite.
              <br />- There are several situations that I don't respond to your
              Slack: I am in the middle of something, I don't have an answer
              (yet), or I think my work is not "ready."
              <br />- I am always very transparent to share my thoughts, ideas,
              questions, and struggles. Sometimes too transparent. I've
              regretted some of the talks I brought up in the past.
              <br />- I am curious. If I ask many questions, I am not
              questioning you but trying to understand better what you think.
              <br />- I express my emotions strongly. It may make me sound like
              I am complaining or in other negative emotions, but I am not. It
              is just how I express myself.
            </p>
            <h3>üâë Feedback</h3>I believe constant feedback is key to growth and
            building a healthy relationship. When you give me feedback, please
            BE DIRECT. Just tell it like it is. No need to sugar-coat difficult
            news or negative feedback for me. I will not take any feedback
            personally, I am thrilled to hear other people telling me how to
            improve myself - work, personality, work style, etc. Both verbal and
            written feedback are welcome, I have a note with all of the feedback
            I received. When you tell me something I don't do well, some tips on
            improving will go a long way.
            <h3>üéàMVPS</h3>
            Here are some behaviors I love seeing:
            <br />- I hope to get the space to do my explorations first then get
            feedback to improve them.
            <br />- Please trust me and believe I can solve complex problems and
            make good designs.
            <br />- Feedback helps me better know myself. If possible, I would
            like to schedule a 1:1 talk with each team member everything 3-6
            months, please share your honest thoughts on what I do good, what I
            should improve.
            <br />- The best way to get me to do something is to tell me that I
            can't do it. I will work hard to prove to myself that I can do it.
            <br />- The best way to get me to do something is to tell me to do
            it without explaining the context.
