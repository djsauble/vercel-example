      <h1>Hey, I'm Meera! üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</h1>

      <p><em>üåé New York, New York , USA</em></p>
      <p><em>üïë Eastern Time</em></p>

      <p>If you're reading this, we either currently work together or will be soon. I'm super excited to learn and grow together and if you want to know a bit more about me and how I work, keep reading! </p>

      <h2>Who am I? </h2>
      <p>Hi, I'm Meera üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è üåø ‚ú®! </p>
      <p>I'm a product designer at DataStax, working on Astra DB. I've gained expertise in data analysis, business leadership, web application development, user research and design. I want to keep learning and challenging myself to grow both my interpersonal and design skills so that I can strive to be the most successful version of myself. 

        I can be both an extrovert and an introvert. I easily adapt to situations and love being around people but often need time alone to recharge. I like to be very organized and will normally be taking notes during meetings to help me think through the problems at hand. 

        Outside of work you can find me going on hikes, exploring new cities, practicing photography, and learning how to cook new foods. I'm very fortunate to have been born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area where we have plenty of great weather, parks and food. 

        You can find more from me at <a href="https://meerabhandare.com">meerabhandare.com</a></p>

        <h2>How I communicate</h2>
        <p>Slack is normally the best way to reach me. If I'm in the middle of work then I may not respond right away but I always get back to my messages as soon as possible. I enjoy meetings if we're talking for the first time or if its best to meet face to face (team building activities, user research sessions and cross-functional team kick offs/reviews).</p>
        <h3> Feedback: </h3>
        <p> I usually prefer to give async feedback through slack with some exceptions. I tend to be more clean when I am able to think through the feedback I want to give and can write it out than in person. 

            For receiving feedback, I appreciate direct and honest feedback and am always looking for ways to grow. I will not take anything to heart and appreciate when I can reflect on myself and ways I can improve. I appreciate both verbal and written feedback and may ask for examples and more explanation to better understand your thought process.</p>

        <h2>MVPS</h2>
        <p> These are behaviors that I love the most in the people I work with: 

        - I appreciate people who help me grow and make it a comfortable environment to ask questions and make mistakes.
        - I like when I'm given the space to explore a project myself and then get feedback to improve from.
        - When people are transparent about what is not going well and ways that they need help. Being transparent creates a better team relationship and more insight into what others are working on.
        - Being willing to talk through problems and bounce ideas off each other is extremely important to me. There are many times where I feel stuck and appreciate people who are able to give me their opinions and thought process on the problem at hand.</p>

        <h2>Growth Areas</h2>

        <p>Here are some areas that I'm personally trying to improve in:

        - When I get really into something I'm working on I forget to slow down. I am learning more now to stop and ask "why" instead of speeding through the process.
        - Although I do find meetings helpful, when I've been in too many of them they tend to drain me. If I'm quiet it normally means I'm thinking through things but I need to work on being more vocal!
        - I tend to be hard on myself and bring on too much work but I am learning how to become better at not spreading myself too thin and asking for help. </p>

        <p>At the end of the day, we're all unique people shaped by our respective life experiences, and we likely have different preferences for how we like to work, so hope you learned a little bit about mine here ü•≥</p>
